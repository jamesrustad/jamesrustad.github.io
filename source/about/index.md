Hello! My name is James and I'm a VFX Supervisor working in the film and television industry. My job is to make fake things look real (and then probably try and blow them up in the prettiest way possible):fire:

This is my personal website and blog, you can read my ramblings on VFX (hopefully not too much), movies, film making and other areas that interest me from time to time.
