For the past few months I've been in the habit of restarting my router at home every few days thinking that something was wrong. Pages seemed to be taking longer and longer to load than I remember. Perhaps the router is just getting old I thought or maybe my laptop is getting a bit long in the tooth. Comparing load times on various machines in various places (home, work, public wifi, etc) I noticed the loading times were pretty similar where ever I went.

I use a 2015 Macbook for most of my computing needs at home, I also have an aging 2012 Mac Mini but both have decent specs even by today's standards; Core i5 CPUs, 8 or 16GB of RAM and fast SSD hard drives. My machine at work is about as fast a machine as you can readily buy yet still loading a simple story on a news website takes about the same 30 seconds each time regardless of the machine you're running it on.

This is ridiculous. The web is slowing down to a crawl when everything else in the tech world is getting faster. A professional news website has to deliver a lot more complex and interactive content than a personal blog like this one, as well as run ads to make it commercially viable at all, but the point remains.

Even scrolling these pages after they load is a painful experience. The framerate of a website containing mostly text should never even be a consideration to a computer made in the last 10 years, yet here we are.

It's little known but a lot of news websites have 'lite' versions of their sites. They often contain no ads, no javascript, no videos, often no images even - just simple lightweight text.

[Text Only NPR](https://text.npr.org)
[Skinny Guardian](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz)
[Legible News](https://legiblenews.com)

These may not be my favourite sources of news but the pages are so lightweight and accessible I'd rather view these than the mess that so many other news sites are these days. These types of websites are out there you just have to look for them.

This is why I've made the aim of my site to always be as light-weight as possible. No bloat. I'll be trying to use WebP for images where I can and sticking to simple text posts like this one too.
