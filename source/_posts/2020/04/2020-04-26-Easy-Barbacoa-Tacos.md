This recipe is my absolute favorite way of making tacos. I seem to be having tacos at least 3 nights a week at the moment. Working from home through the Covid-19 pandemic has it's downsides, but one of the best things about it is being able to use my slow cooker more. I can kick off something like this around lunch time and by 7-8pm I've got dinner ready to go.

## Ingredients

+ 2lb (1kg) beef chuck roast chopped up in to big cubes - any cheap slow cooking cut like short ribs, flank, stew pieces, etc will work.
+ 1 small yellow onion - sliced thin
+ 2 cloves of garlic - crushed
+ 2-3 chipotles en adobo - with some of the sauce and chopped small (I use [these](https://www.iga.net/en/product/sauceadobo-chipotle-peppers/00000_000000007639788910))
+ 1 tbsp each of Mexican chilli powder, paprika, oregano, salt, pepper - honestly whatever spices you have, just grab them all.
+ 1 cup beef broth - [this](https://www.iga.net/en/product/brothready-to-serve-beef/00000_000000006321114358) stuff works well
+ 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar - this is important. It not only adds flavor but breaks down the tough meat when cooking.
+ 2 tbsp soy sauce
+ 1 tbsp of oil for frying - eg canola or sunflower.

## Cooking

I start by heating the oil on high and browning the meat in a cast iron skillet. You can be quite aggressive with the browning. The more color you put on here the more flavor you get in the slow cook later on.

While the meat is browning add the onions to the slow cooker bowl as well as the chipotles, garlic and dry spices. I tend to not fry the onions, garlic, spices etc as well as the meat. At the temperature i'm cooking the beef at they would burn too quickly.

Once the meat is well browned on all sides, add to the hot skillet the beef broth, vinegar and soy sauce. This will deglaze the pan and release all the sticky stuff in to the liquid with a bit of stirring. This only takes a 30 seconds or so, don't let it boil and reduce too much - you want that liquid for the slow cooker.

Transfer the meat from the skillet to the slow cooker, put the lid on and leave it on low for about 7-8 hours. Don't be tempted to lift the lid and check how it's doing, you need to keep the heat in on slow cookers. Once done, the meat should be falling apart and you should have ~1 cup of liquid in the bowl. Use tongs and a fork to shred the meat up and stir in with the liquid which should be mostly absorbed by the beef.

Serve on heated corn tortillas with your favorite taco toppings!
