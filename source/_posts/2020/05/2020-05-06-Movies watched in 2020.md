| # | Title | Released | Watched | Review | Rating |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Two Popes  | 2020  | Jan 10  | Interesting. Not sure how much this really follows the facts, but fantastic to watch two of the best actors in the business go at it. | 3.5  |
| 2  | Star Wars: Episode 9  | 2019  | Jan 15  | I liked it! I know it walks all over 8 but it's star wars, what's not to like.  | 3.5 |
| 3  | Knives Out  | 2019  | Jan 22  | Good performances from the all the cast. I kind of solved the ending about 15 mins before the end but enjoyable.  | 4 |
| 4  | Parasite  | 2019  | Feb 15  | Excellent. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Interesting plot twists and plenty to say about the lives of the rich and poor.  | 5  |
| 5  | Aladdin  | 2019  | Feb 19  | One of the better Disney remakes I've seen. Different enough from the original to be interesting, familiar enough to be memorable.  | 4  |
| 6  | Bird Box  | 2018  | Feb 29  | I'd listened to the audio book of this before I saw it so knew what to expect. Felt like it was rushing through the story to me. Would have worked better as a 6 part series.  | 2  |
| 7  | Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.  | 2017  | Mar 02  | Much better than I expected it to be. Jack Black gives a great performance, whilst the others are kind of predictable.  | 4  |
| 8  | Once upon a time in Hollywood  | 2019  | Mar 07  | Fantastic. Like all Tarentino movies they're so unique compared with everything else made today. Really liked how they handled the ending. Might be one of my favourite QT movies.  | 5 |
| 9  |  Ad Astra |  2019 | Mar 19  | Looks Beautiful and Brad Pitt gives a good performance. Plot holes drag it down a bit and Tommy Lee Jones felt miscast.  | 3  |
| 10  | Cats  | 2020 | Apr 01  | The less said the better I think. | 1 |
| 11  | Contagion  | 2011  | Apr 10  | Topical, obviously. Interesting to contrast how the Hollywood version diverges from reality.   | 2 |
| 12  | The Biggest Little Farm  | 2020  | Apr 26  | Cute. Felt like I was watching the product of a venture capital's brain storm on marketing ideas, but watchable.  | 3  |
| 13  | Kung Fu Panda  | 2008  | May 03  | I enjoyed it! Dustin Hoffman steals the show as Shifu. Short and sweet, surprised actually how well it stands up today.  | 4  |
| 14  | Isle of Dogs  | 2018  | May 07  | Utterly distinctive. It's the details and design of *every little thing* that make the difference. Loved it.  | 4  |
