What a month that week was! I've been in really busy in final delivery for my current project at work so haven't had a huge amount of time to work on this blog. I had planned to start making another post looking at composition of shots and what goes in to them, that'll come soon. I have found some time to learn a bit more CSS and tinkering around with different ways to present images on this website. I updated my last post about Psycho to have the lines overlay and fade over the original image now rather than sit below it which I think is a neater presentation and keeps the post a bit smaller without impacting performance on the site as it's all just a bit of simple, vanilla CSS.

With the sad, inevitable slow down in post production that will be coming our way due to most worldwide filming pausing for C-19 I'll hopefully get a bit more time over the summer to work on other hobbies.

## (Un)real Engine

Well at least we know what the next Tomb Raider is going to look like. Whilst of course so much of what is seen in [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5KtatMcUw) is down to the wizard and not the wand, the technology on display here leaves me in awe of what is now possible (as long as you have a few TB spare on your hard drive). Realtime lighting has always been a far off dream in VFX (I'm still yet to see katana able to put a checkerboard on a plane and do real time lighting). Of course, there are tricks in play here that perhaps wouldn't really stand up to photoreal scrutiny, but I would still take this over a 4 hour+ render any day when it can be tweaked further in comp with the right passes. Lifting the polygon limit, as they claim here, I think still needs some looking at if it's really true - this has been one of the problems with using game engines in VFX in the past.

If this is really a true demo using realistic (as in reasonably sized) assets and textures (and I think it's a big ***if*** at the moment) then it's a genuine game changer. I imagine this 5 minute demo might be taking 500GB+, but still it's beautiful... I'll hopefully give this a go one of these days and see what it can do.

Anyone who knows my gaming habits knows _Tomb Raider_ is my absolute favourite all time franchise - pleeeease let the next TR game look even half as good as this!

## Watching
Not much time to watch TV this week being in delivery on my current project(s) but I fancied a couple of familiar movies that I'd seen a few times and didn't have to concentrate on too much; Seven and Ocean's 11.

## Gaming
I did manage to steal a few minutes to try and pick _Fallout 4_ back up. I'd put a lot of time in to the game before Christmas and felt like i'd kind of done everything in the base game (I'm **sure** I haven't though) so the world felt a little bit empty overall. Maybe I'll pick up the season pass and play some of the DLC; Far Harbour is supposed to be a great expansion.

On the back of that _Fallout 4_ failure I've fired up my PS3 again and will have a go at _Fallout: New Vegas_. I played a bit before but never completed the main story for one reason or another. I'm loving this world at the moment though so hopefully I can give it a better shot this time.

## Around the Web

+ [We should be very wary of the R value](https://unherd.com/2020/05/what-the-headline-covid-figures-dont-tell-you/)

The R<sub>0</sub> rate is apparently climbing back to near 1 in many places. This is an easy headline for media to report how everything is burning down, but closer analysis of this means R<sub>0</sub> climbing a bit is actually a ***good*** thing and showing that the lockdown is working. This is due to an interesting quirk of statistics called [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).
