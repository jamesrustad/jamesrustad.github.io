I've decided to start keeping 'weeknotes'. One of the best things to come out of this whole C-19 tragedy has been an opportunity to spend time on personal projects and i've been reading a lot more blogs. I've been particularly following programmers blogs as they seem to be the most easy to find and, frankly, the most numerous. Whilst I have little skill and knowledge in programming languages and the advanced technical discussions that take place on many of them is sadly lost on me, I have really enjoyed reading the more accessible ones that discuss more general topics about their lives and interests outside of programming.

Many of the more active blogs post a weekly diary of things they've discovered over the past 7 days. What they're working on and interesting links and articles from across the web. I think it's a good practice to get in to - it encourages you to actually do some stuff in the week to have something to write about if nothing else! In the current climate it's important to keep busy and try and be productive where you can and I think keeping a record of what you've done, discovered, and perhaps even missed, is a great thing to do.
