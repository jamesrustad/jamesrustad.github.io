#### May 10th 2020

I've decided to start keeping 'weeknotes'. One of the best things to come out of this whole C-19 tragedy has been an opportunity to spend time on personal projects and i've been reading a lot more blogs, as well as having time to work more on this one. I've been particularly following programmers blogs as they seem to be the most easy to find and, frankly, the most numerous.

Whilst I have little skill and knowledge in programming languages and the advanced technical discussions that take place on many of them is sadly lost on me, I have really enjoyed reading some of the more accessible ones that discuss more general topics about technology, their lives and interests outside of programming.

Many of the more active blogs post a weekly diary of things they've discovered over the past 7 days. What they're working on and interesting links and articles from across the web. I think it's a good practice to get in to - it encourages you to actually do some stuff in the week to have something to write about if nothing else!

In the current climate it's important to keep busy and try and be productive where you can and I think keeping a record of what you've done, uncovered, and perhaps even missed, is a great thing to do. I've committed to trying to become a more *active producer* rather than *passive consumer*.

## The New Normal

I'm not sure I have anything unique or articulate to say about Covid-19 except that I miss going out for food. I can live without the social interaction better than I imagined. I don't particularly miss the old routines of my life, and I certainly don't miss the commute to work and office life. But I do miss a properly cooked wood-fired pizza. Selfish with everything else going on in the world, I know. I miss dumplings, a proper bowl of ramen and ordering 4 different types of tacos. I'm going to eat out so much when all this is over.

Somehow this still doesn't all seem real, maybe I'm incredibly lucky to be able to think this way - I've not had any personal tragedies or even known anyone who has had this thing. I only hope it stays that way.

I'm increasingly turned off by this phrase '***The New Normal***'. Police patrolling public spaces, fining people for getting exercise *cannot* be the new normal. Now, more than ever, in these unprecedented times, as we realize that we're all in this together, standing side by side<sup>*</sup> this cannot be the new normal. Read *1984* and be the change, y'all.

## Watching
On the recommendation of a friend I watched ***'The Night Of'***. It was amazing. Truly one of the best short series I've ever watched. The story is gripping, the acting is perfectly cast (so rare), with fantastic performances from Michael K. Williams and Riz Ahmed in particular. The real winner for me was the cinematography however. I don't think I've seen a TV show that was filmed so 'lavishly' for a while and the way it was all shot added so much to the scenes and elevated the story. *Highly* recommended.

## Gaming
I downloaded ***Farming Simulator 19*** as it was one of the PS Plus games of the month. I lasted about 30 minutes. I'm *sure* it's a good game for that niche market and refreshing change from so many run of the mill action adventures, but I just haven't got the level of concentration at the moment to play it with everything else going on.

I've been playing a lot of 2 olddddd games I used to play in my teens called ***Pharaoh*** and ***Empire:Rise of the Middle Kingdom***. They're super chill, city builder time wasters, just what the doctor ordered right now. You can pick them up on GoG for pennies.

I haven't read most of these, but if you only read one, make it [this](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/guantanamos-darkest-secret). Ben Taub's examination of the relationship between a Guantanmo guard and his prisoner is a facisnating read. Long, but worth your time.
