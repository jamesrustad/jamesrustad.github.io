As interesting as my [taco recipes](https://jamesrustad.github.io/2020/04/26/2020/04/2020-04-26-Easy-Barbacoa-Tacos/) are this is supposed to be a blog about film and the craft of making films. I've been thinking about doing a series of blog posts on this subject for a while but couldn't find the right angle that I wanted to explore.

I often remark in my job as a VFX supervisor how sometimes shots just 'don't work'. They're sometimes just not well executed. Sometimes they're not well planned or just haven't come together in the right way in the end. It's hard to explain why and this is often my fault in not sculpting the visual effects for a shot in the right way, but quite often I believe the shot itself just is poorly conceived from the beginning. This is no criticism of the Director of Photography or Director; there are a million reasons why a shot might just not work.

I've been a long time fan of the work of director Alfred Hitchcock. He was a master of shot-making and composition and it's hard to find an example of a shot in one of his movies that doesn't work. It's been said that he used to plan out the details of the entire movie he was making, right down to the focal length and lens he would use to film *each shot*, well before the project began filming. Watching Hitchcock's movies is like watching a masterclass in film making and I particularly admire his skills of shot composition.

I'd like to try in this first blog post, in what I hope will be a series, to explain a bit and learn more myself about the process of film making. What makes a shot work, or not, and why? By analysing an example from the great man himself I'll try and explain why I feel his films are so well composed visually.

**Note**: This post inevitably contains spoilers. If you haven't watched *Psycho* before just stop reading now and please go and watch it immediately. It's one of the all-time great thrillers.

## Lines are everywhere

When designing a shot a good director will make sure that you are looking at exactly what they want you to be looking at. It might sound obvious when put like that but it's harder than it might appear to focus the audiences attention. Every shot is another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of their movie and there is no room for wasted elements or a shot that misses its mark. To do this, a good shot needs a skeleton to build on. The *lines* of a shot are that skeleton and must be well constructed.

Used correctly lines can convey a feeling of calm or of fear, they can impart a sense of strength and power or make a shot more playful and organic. Even the same source material composed differently can lead the lines of a shot to have a completely different feeling and tell a different story to the audience.

The very opening titles of Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho* are full of lines.

The very first shot of the movie is just a series of horizontal lines. Horizontal lines sit in complete harmony with the longest edges of the frame and are often used to convey a sense of passive calm. We associate them with wide-open spaces, peaceful ocean horizons. Someone lying horizontally is passive, no threat. However in this case they're staggered and, combined with Bernard Herrmann's chilling violin score, they create a sense of _disharmony_, frenzy, and unease.

Hitchcock follows up with a shot of vertical lines. Vertical lines are defiant. They defy gravity and they stand tall. They tower over us and remind us of strong, immovable objects like trees and buildings. A vertical line through an image can create a barrier between objects. They allow us to explore up and down an image, but often too, they center our focus to what lies between them in way that horizontal lines do not.

As the opening sequence progresses we're shown these two elements competing with each other, becoming more and more disordered. A perfect, simple, introduction to a movie called **Psycho**.

From the opening credits we move to shots over the city of Pheonix, AZ. Plenty of vertical lines to admire before we arrive at this shot:

Horizontal lines are often used to let our eyes move around the image from side to side without wandering too far off-axis but can present quite a boring image if there isn't a whole lot else to look at. An image of a window with horizontal blinds presented square to camera and flatty lit doesn't give you much to look at or a desire to explore further.

Hitchcock chooses to slightly angle the camera approach to the window to create a more interesting composition. This is the first diagonal or 'off square' line we're shown in the movie. Combined with the shadows also at an angle it's an intriguing image that invites us to explore further and want to know what's on the other side of that window.

Diagonal lines often create a sense of imbalance and disorder, that is if they don't have a dominant orientation. With a dominant or consistent orientation like we see here they can be a powerful tool to lead the eye. In the case of this window the angle of the shadow from the bottom right corner towards the center of frame and the bottom left corner shadow from the window ledge achieve the same thing. They lead our eye inside the window. The darkness in the room however reveals nothing initially and leaves us wanting to know what's inside.
