I’ve been in really busy in final delivery for my current project at work so haven’t had a huge amount of time to work on this blog. I had planned to start making another post looking at composition of shots and what goes in to them, that’ll come soon. I have found some time to learn a bit more CSS and tinkering around with different ways to present images on this website. I updated my last post about Psycho to have the lines overlay and fade over the original image now rather than sit below it which I think is a neater presentation and keeps the post a bit smaller without impacting performance on the site as it’s all just a bit of simple, vanilla CSS.</p><p>With the sad, inevitable slow down in post production that will be coming our way due to most worldwide filming pausing for C-19 I’ll hopefully get a bit more time over the summer to work on other hobbies.</p><h2 id="Un-real-Engine"><a href="#Un-real-Engine" class="headerlink" title="(Un)real Engine"></a>(Un)real Engine</h2><img style="border: 2px solid;border-radius: 8px" src="/images/2020/05/unreal01.jpg"><p>Well at least we know what the next Tomb Raider is going to look like. Whilst of course so much of what is seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5KtatMcUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this demo</a> is down to the wizard and not the wand, the technology on display here leaves me in awe of what is now possible (as long as you have a few TB spare on your hard drive). Realtime lighting has always been a far off dream in VFX (I’m still yet to see katana able to put a checkerboard on a plane and do real time lighting). Of course, there are tricks in play here that perhaps wouldn’t really stand up to photoreal scrutiny, but I would still take this over a 4 hour+ render any day when it can be tweaked further in comp with the right passes. Lifting the polygon limit, as they claim here, I think still needs some looking at if it’s really true - this has been one of the problems with using game engines in VFX in the past.</p><p>If this is really a true demo using realistic (as in reasonably sized) assets and textures (and I think it’s a big <strong><em>if</em></strong> at the moment) then it’s a genuine game changer. I imagine this 5 minute demo might be taking 500GB+, but still it’s beautiful… I’ll hopefully give this a go one of these days and see what it can do.</p><p>Anyone who knows my gaming habits knows <em>Tomb Raider</em> is my absolute favourite all time franchise - pleeeease let the next TR game look even half as good as this!</p><h2 id="Watching"><a href="#Watching" class="headerlink" title="Watching"></a>Watching</h2><p>Not much time to watch TV this week being in delivery on my current project(s) but I fancied a couple of familiar movies that I’d seen a few times and didn’t have to concentrate on too much; Seven and Ocean’s 11.</p><h2 id="Gaming"><a href="#Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Gaming"></a>Gaming</h2><p>I did manage to steal a few minutes to try and pick <em>Fallout 4</em> back up. I’d put a lot of time in to the game before Christmas and felt like i’d kind of done everything in the base game (I’m <strong>sure</strong> I haven’t though) so the world felt a little bit empty overall. Maybe I’ll pick up the season pass and play some of the DLC; Far Harbour is supposed to be a great expansion.</p><p>On the back of that <em>Fallout 4</em> failure I’ve fired up my PS3 again and will have a go at <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. I played a bit before but never completed the main story for one reason or another. I’m loving this world at the moment though so hopefully I can give it a better shot this time.</p><h2 id="Around-the-Web"><a href="#Around-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="Around the Web"></a>Around the Web</h2><ul><li><a href="https://unherd.com/2020/05/what-the-headline-covid-figures-dont-tell-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We should be very wary of the R value</a></li></ul><p>The R<sub>0</sub> rate is apparently climbing back to near 1 in many places.

One of the best things to come out of this whole C-19 tragedy has been an opportunity to spend time on personal projects and i’ve been reading a lot more blogs, as well as having time to work more on this one. I’ve been particularly following programmers blogs as they seem to be the most easy to find and, frankly, the most numerous.</p><p>Whilst I have little skill and knowledge in programming languages and the advanced technical discussions that take place on many of them is sadly lost on me, I have really enjoyed reading some of the more accessible ones that discuss more general topics about technology, their lives and interests outside of programming.</p><p>Many of the more active blogs post a weekly diary of things they’ve discovered over the past 7 days. What they’re working on and interesting links and articles from across the web. I think it’s a good practice to get in to - it encourages you to actually do some stuff in the week to have something to write about if nothing else!</p><p>In the current climate it’s important to keep busy and try and be productive where you can and I think keeping a record of what you’ve done, uncovered, and perhaps even missed, is a great thing to do. I’ve committed to trying to become a more <em>active producer</em> rather than <em>passive consumer</em>.</p><h2 id="The-New-Normal"><a href="#The-New-Normal" class="headerlink" title="The New Normal"></a>The New Normal</h2><img style="float: right; margin-left: 22px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 15px; border: 2px solid;border-radius: 8px" src="/images/2020/05/pigeon.jpg"><p>I’m not sure I have anything unique or articulate to say about Covid-19 except that I miss going out for food. I can live without the social interaction better than I imagined. I don’t particularly miss the old routines of my life, and I certainly don’t miss the commute to work and office life. But I do miss a properly cooked wood-fired pizza. Selfish with everything else going on in the world, I know. I miss dumplings, a proper bowl of ramen and ordering 4 different types of tacos. I’m going to eat out so much when all this is over.</p><p>Somehow this still doesn’t all seem real, maybe I’m incredibly lucky to be able to think this way - I’ve not had any personal tragedies or even known anyone who has had this thing. I only hope it stays that way.</p><p>I’m increasingly turned off by this phrase ‘<strong><em>The New Normal</em></strong>‘. Police patrolling public spaces, fining people for getting exercise <em>cannot</em> be the new normal. Now, more than ever, in these unprecedented times, as we realize that we’re all in this together, standing side by side<sup>*</sup> this cannot be the new normal. Read <em>1984</em> and be the change, y’all.</p><p><sup>*</sup><sub>but still 6 feet apart</sub></p><h2 id="Watching"><a href="#Watching" class="headerlink" title="Watching"></a>Watching</h2><p>On the recommendation of a friend I watched <strong><em>‘The Night Of’</em></strong>. It was amazing. Truly one of the best short series I’ve ever watched. The story is gripping, the acting is perfectly cast (so rare), with fantastic performances from Michael K. Williams and Riz Ahmed in particular. The real winner for me was the cinematography however. I don’t think I’ve seen a TV show that was filmed so ‘lavishly’ for a while and the way it was all shot added so much to the scenes and elevated the story. <em>Highly</em> recommended.</p><h2 id="Gaming"><a href="#Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Gaming"></a>Gaming</h2><p>I downloaded <strong><em>Farming Simulator 19</em></strong> as it was one of the PS Plus games of the month. I lasted about 30 minutes. I’m <em>sure</em> it’s a good game for that niche market and refreshing change from so many run of the mill action adventures, but I just haven’t got the level of concentration at the moment to play it with everything else going on.</p><p>I’ve been playing a lot of 2 olddddd games I used to play in my teens called <strong><em>Pharaoh</em></strong> and <strong><em>Empire:Rise of the Middle Kingdom</em></strong>. They’re super chill, city builder time wasters, just what the doctor ordered right now. You can pick them up on GoG for pennies.</p><h2 id="Around-the-Web"><a href="#Around-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="Around the Web"></a>Around the Web</h2><ul><li><p>Find Twitch streamers who have no one watching them!<br><a href="https://twitchroulette.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitchroulette.net</a></p></li><li><p>2020 Pulitzer prize winners announced<br><a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/news/announcement-2020-pulitzer-prize-winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pulitzer.org/news/announcement-2020-pulitzer-prize-winners</a></p></li></ul><p>I haven’t read most of these, but if you only read one, make it <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/guantanamos-darkest-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="/assets/css/APlayer.min.css"><script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><p>As interesting as my <a href="https://jamesrustad.github.io/2020/04/26/2020/04/2020-04-26-Easy-Barbacoa-Tacos/">taco recipes</a> are this is supposed to be a blog about film and the craft of making films. I’ve been thinking about doing a series of blog posts on this subject for a while but couldn’t find the right angle that I wanted to explore.</p><p>I often remark in my job as a VFX supervisor how sometimes shots just ‘don’t work’. They’re sometimes not well executed. Sometimes they’re not well planned or haven’t come together in the right way in the end. It’s hard to explain why and this is often my fault in not sculpting the visual effects for a shot in the right way, but sometimes the shot itself is unfortunately poorly conceived from the beginning. This is no criticism of the Director of Photography or Director; there are a million reasons why a shot might not work.</p><p>I’ve been a long time fan of the work of director <strong><em>Alfred Hitchcock</em></strong>. He was a master of shot-making and composition and it’s hard to find an example of a shot in one of his movies that doesn’t work. He used to plan out the details of the entire movie he was making, right down to the focal length and lens he would use to film <em>each shot</em>, well before the project began filming. Watching Hitchcock’s movies is watching a masterclass in film making and I particularly admire his skills of shot composition.</p><p>I’d like to try in this first blog post (in what I hope will be a series) to explain a bit about the process of film making and learn more myself along the way. What makes a shot work, or not, and why? By analyzing an example from the great man himself I’ll try and explain why his films are so well composed visually.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>This post inevitably contains spoilers. If you haven’t watched <strong><em>Psycho</em></strong> before stop reading now and please go and watch it immediately. It’s one of the all-time great thrillers of cinema.</em></p><hr><h2 id="Lines-are-everywhere"><a href="#Lines-are-everywhere" class="headerlink" title="Lines are everywhere"></a>Lines are everywhere</h2><p>When designing a shot a good director will make sure that you are looking at exactly what they want you to be looking at. It might sound obvious when put like that but it’s harder than it might appear to focus the attention of the audience. Every shot is another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of their movie and there is no room for wasted elements or a shot that misses its mark. To do this, a good shot needs a skeleton to build on. The <em>lines</em> of a shot are that skeleton and must be well constructed.</p><p>Used correctly lines can convey a feeling of calm or of fear, they can impart a sense of strength and power or make a shot more playful and organic. Even the same source material composed differently can lead the lines of a shot to have a completely different feeling and tell a different story to the audience.</p><p>The very opening titles of Alfred Hitchcock’s <em>Psycho</em> are full of lines.</p><p><img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0002.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0007.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0022.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The very first shot of the movie is just a series of horizontal lines. <strong>Horizontal lines</strong> sit in complete harmony with the longest edges of the frame and are often used to convey a sense of passive calm. We associate them with wide-open spaces, peaceful ocean horizons. Someone lying horizontally is passive, no threat. However, in this case, they’re staggered and, combined with Bernard Herrmann’s chilling violin score, they create a sense of <em>disharmony</em>, frenzy, and unease.</p><p>Hitchcock follows up with a shot of vertical lines. <strong>Vertical lines</strong> are defiant. They defy gravity and they stand tall. They tower over us and remind us of strong, immovable objects like trees, walls and buildings. A vertical line through an image can create a barrier between objects. They allow us to explore up and down an image, but often too, they can reframe the sides of an image and center our focus to what lies between them in way that horizontal lines do not.</p><p>As the opening sequence progresses we’re shown these two elements competing with each other, becoming more and more disordered. A perfect, simple, introduction to a movie called <strong>Psycho</strong>.</p><p>From the opening credits we move to shots over the city of Pheonix, AZ. Plenty of vertical lines to admire before we arrive at this shot:</p><div class="beforeAfter">  <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0027.jpg">  <div class="beforeAfterOverlay">    <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0027-b.jpg">  </div></div><p>Horizontal lines are often used to let our eyes move around the image from side to side without wandering too far off-axis but can present quite a boring image if there isn’t a lot else to look at. An image of a window with horizontal blinds presented square to camera and flatly lit doesn’t give you much to look at or a desire to explore further.</p><p>Hitchcock chooses to slightly angle the camera approach to the window to create a more interesting composition. This is the first diagonal or ‘off square’ line we’re shown in the movie. Combined with the shadows also at an angle it’s an intriguing image that invites us to explore further and want to know what’s on the other side of that window.</p><p><strong>Diagonal lines</strong> often create a sense of imbalance and disorder, that is if they don’t have a dominant orientation. With a dominant or consistent orientation like we see here, they can be a powerful tool to lead the eye. In the case of this window, the angle of the shadow from the bottom right corner towards the center of frame and the bottom left corner shadow from the window ledge achieve the same thing. They lead our eye inside the window. The darkness in the room reveals nothing initially and leaves us wanting to know what’s inside.</p><h2 id="The-30-day-film"><a href="#The-30-day-film" class="headerlink" title="The 30-day film"></a>The 30-day film</h2><p><em>Psycho</em> was a film that nearly never got made. When Hitchcock informed his studio, Paramount, that the title to his next picture was going to be called *”Psycho”* they didn’t like it. They first tried to dissuade him by lowering the film’s budget and then by informing him that all the studio’s stages were fully booked around the time he wanted to shoot. Undeterred he decided to take the lower budget, film in black and white to save costs and moved production down the road to Universal Studios. The whole film was shot in just 30 days. The no-frills approach to the project seemed to suit him, The New York Times quoted him in a later interview as saying</p><blockquote><p>Nothing about it to distract from telling the tale, just like the old days.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Lines-must-be-carefully-placed"><a href="#Lines-must-be-carefully-placed" class="headerlink" title="Lines must be carefully placed"></a>Lines must be carefully placed</h2><p>Understanding how the orientation of lines in a frame affect its mood is a useful tool for storytelling but it needs to be combined with good placement as well. Badly placed lines can have negative effects on the composition of an image.</p><p>Lines that divide a frame in two down the center draw strong attention to that which is in the middle of frame, it’s a good way to get focus the audience on what you want them to look at. Something of a trademark shot for Alfred Hitchcock are his full-frame portrait shots of characters. By this point in the film we’ve followed Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) as she’s stolen money from her employer to start a new life with her boyfriend in Los Angeles.</p><div class="beforeAfter">  <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0175.jpg">  <div class="beforeAfterOverlay">    <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0175-b.jpg">  </div></div><p>The placement of lines in this shot draws your attention to her eyes and the full range of emotions going on inside her as she wrestles with whether she’s done the right thing.</p><p>A shot composed off-center or from the side wouldn’t have the same impact visually. It might be useful to tell more about where she is in relation to the landscape or other such details. The point of this sequence of shots framed this way however is to have us focus on her. Framing Marion this way with other lines in the scene guiding us back towards her when we might be wandering elsewhere works perfectly. Framing her eyes at the same level as the horizon ensures that even when we scan around the shot, the horizontal line of the horizon leads us back to her eyes. The sides of the road do the same thing.</p><p>The placement of lines in a scene can also be a powerful way to show subliminal moments happening between characters. Lines at the edges of frame can push two characters closer together in a romance, say, or in the case of the shot below, they put up a visual wall between people to imply a barrier between them. A barrier perhaps that one person will not, or cannot, cross.</p><div class="beforeAfter">  <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0277.jpg">  <div class="beforeAfterOverlay">    <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0277-b.jpg">  </div></div><h2 id="Learn-the-rules-so-you-know-how-to-break-them"><a href="#Learn-the-rules-so-you-know-how-to-break-them" class="headerlink" title="Learn the rules so you know how to break them"></a>Learn the rules so you know how to break them</h2><p>“The rule of thirds” is a well known composition technique that places lines of interest at 1/3 and 2/3 positions of height or width within the frame. It’s a harmonious relationship that suits the eye comfortably and is very often used. Subverting this by dividing through the center of frame is a powerful way to create shots with an odd feeling or that something is wrong and can help create tension. Used incorrectly though it can create a monotonous framing that lacks interest.</p><p>There is also an implied line in most shots that we never notice; that being the diagonal from one corner to the other. This can be useful to connect items and particularly works well in combination with the rule of thirds to bring together the two sides of an image that you’ve laid down from upper 1/3 to lower 1/3. Here in this shot, Marion’s (and the audience’s) attention is brought back to the newspaper in her handbag that she realizes she can use to hide the stolen money. The shot is well framed to make this connection easy to read.</p><div class="beforeAfter">  <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0252.jpg">  <div class="beforeAfterOverlay">    <img src="/images/2020/04/psycho-0252-b.jpg">  </div></div><p>The rule of thirds is quite often used in conversation sequences. You just place each character at 1/3 spacing and the natural, harmonious framing makes for an easy on the eye composition that’s not too distracting in other ways. Breaking this relationship in a conversation even for just a shot or two is a clever way to give an otherwise comfortable conversation a moment of tension.</p><p>Here Norman Bates (played by Anthony Hopkins) is framed at 1/3 from the right and the conversation is charming and easy, but as Marion explores his relationship with his mother it takes a direction he doesn’t like and he leans forward. Moving his framing to center screen focuses our attention on him more, creates a stronger image that concentrates the hostility and a makes for an unsettling, tense moment. The tension is released when he leans back, smiles and the conversation returns to a lighter tone with its usual rule of thirds framing.</p><p><img src="/images/2020/04/psycho_03xx_a.jpg" alt=""></p><h2 id="The-Zen-of-Lines"><a href="#The-Zen-of-Lines" class="headerlink" title="The Zen of Lines"></a>The Zen of Lines</h2><p>The “shower scene” in <em>Psycho</em> is one of the greatest moments of cinema. It’s less than a minute long but took 7 days to film. When it was shown in theatres, audiences at the time were shocked that the leading actress could be murdered not even 1/2 of the way through the movie. It had never been done in such a way and it gave <em>Psycho</em> it’s “word of mouth” reputation that made it the must-see movie, one of the biggest box office successes of the year and indeed of Alfred Hitchcock’s career.</p><p>I’ve talked a lot so far about how lines can create harmony and balance in a shot. Harmonious compositions of lines in a shot usually follow a consistent pattern and direction and are effective in quieter, calmer shots of a movie, like the opening shot of <em>Psycho</em> with the window discussed above. A composition of contrasting lines, following many directions and even changing drastically during a shot create energy and intensity. They can even be used to heighten the sense of disorder, confusion and chaos. Like during a violent shower stabbing perhaps.</p><p><img src="/images/2020/04/psycho_shower.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The sequence is bookended by two simple shots of a running shower (1,7). The lines are obvious to see and create a sense of balance and restoration of order around the shots of the murder. One of my all-time favorite shots in any movie is the shot at (2). The shot is slightly oddly framed at the beginning, the right hand side of the shot is unbalanced with the water moving one way against the orientation of Marion. The empty space on the left side is more structured; the vertical lines in the shower curtain giving order and stability, stability that is broken by the blurry figure approaching through the door way.</p><p>The shot where the curtain is ripped back revealing the murderer (3) is a jarring moment of visual confusion; the lines are all over the place and the shower rail and the edge of the curtain narrow our focus to the horrifying figure wielding the knife. Horror movies make frequent use of this kind of iconic “z-shaped” pose at their most terrifying moments as it’s visually dynamic and gives instant tension to a shot.</p><p>The subsequent, relentless, shots of the murder (4,5) are always chaotic. The water is always moving in different angles from shot to shot which never gives us a chance to orient ourselves in the moment. To be presented with so many different angles and lines so quickly is explosive and confusing.</p><p>As the murder finishes, order begins to come back to the sequence (6,7). Swirling lines of water down the plughole become more ordered over time but still contrast with each other and the edges of frame. This allows some visual interest before the final shot of the sequence; simple harmonious water lines from the showerhead.</p><h2 id="Making-the-movie-on-paper"><a href="#Making-the-movie-on-paper" class="headerlink" title="Making the movie on paper"></a>Making the movie on paper</h2><p>Alfred Hitchcock never sought to be a perfectionist. He was an experimentalist at heart, yet there was no room for improvisation in his movies. He put great effort into the preparation and planning of his shots. He storyboarded everything with his production designers and kept them to hand on set so everyone involved could see what they were collectively trying to achieve, in every shot and scene.</p><p>In doing so he could prepare each shot to have the correct lines of motion, and of meaning, to give maximum impact and create the best composition each time.</p><blockquote><p>The most glaring omission in the conventional script, I believe, is camera movement.<br>– <cite>Alfred Hitchcock</cite></p></blockquote><hr><p>In future blog posts, I’ll try to examine more techniques of shot composition and other areas of film making from Hitchcock and other directors that explore more what makes a shot work, or not.

I seem to be having tacos at least 3 nights a week at the moment. Working from home through the Covid-19 pandemic has it’s downsides, but one of the best things about it is being able to use my slow cooker more. I can kick off something like this around lunch time and by 7-8pm I’ve got dinner ready to go.</p><h2 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2lb (1kg) beef chuck roast chopped up in to big cubes - any cheap slow cooking cut like short ribs, flank, stew pieces, etc will work.</li><li>1 small yellow onion - sliced thin</li><li>2 cloves of garlic - crushed</li><li>2-3 chipotles en adobo - with some of the sauce and chopped small (I use <a href="https://www.iga.net/en/product/sauceadobo-chipotle-peppers/00000_000000007639788910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these</a>)</li><li>1 tbsp each of Mexican chilli powder, paprika, oregano, salt, pepper - honestly whatever spices you have, just grab them all.</li><li>1 cup beef broth - <a href="https://www.iga.net/en/product/brothready-to-serve-beef/00000_000000006321114358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> stuff works well</li><li>2 tbsp apple cider vinegar - this is important. It not only adds flavour but breaks down the tough meat when cooking.</li><li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li><li>1 tbsp of oil for frying - eg canola or sunflower.</li></ul><h2 id="Cooking"><a href="#Cooking" class="headerlink" title="Cooking"></a>Cooking</h2><p>I start by heating the oil on high and browning the meat in a cast iron skillet. You can be quite aggressive with the browning. The more colour you put on here the more flavour you get in the slow cook later on.</p><p>While the meat is browning add the onions to the slow cooker bowl as well as the chipotles, garlic and dry spices. I tend to not fry the onions, garlic, spices etc as well as the meat. At the temperature i’m cooking the beef at they would burn too quickly.</p><p>Once the meat is well browned on all sides, add to the hot skillet the beef broth, vinegar and soy sauce. This will deglaze the pan and release all the sticky stuff in to the liquid with a bit of stirring. This only takes a 30 seconds or so, don’t let it boil and reduce too much - you want that liquid for the slow cooker.</p><p>Transfer the meat from the skillet to the slow cooker, put the lid on and leave it on low for about 7-8 hours. Don’t be tempted to lift the lid and check how it’s doing, you need to keep the heat in on slow cookers. Once done, the meat should be falling apart and you should have ~1 cup of liquid in the bowl. Use tongs and a fork to shred the meat up and stir in with the liquid which should be mostly absorbed by the beef.</p><p>Serve on heated corn tortillas with your favourite taco toppings!</p><p><img src="/images/2020/04/IMG_20200411_182956.jpg" alt=""></p><p><img src="/images/2020/04/IMG_20200424_184923.jpg" alt=""></p><hr><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Getting Started Blogging with Hexo</title>
      <link href="/2020/03/15/2020/03/2020-03-15-getting-started/"/>
      <url>/2020/03/15/2020/03/2020-03-15-getting-started/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" class="aplayer-secondary-style-marker" href="/assets/css/APlayer.min.css"><script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js" class="aplayer-secondary-script-marker"></script><p>This website is my personal blog and is intentionally minimal, lightweight and simple. (Reasons on why coming in a future blog post). It has been built with <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Hexo</code></a>, deployed with <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Git</code></a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>GitHub Pages</code></a>. Eventually I might look in to setting up a custom URL domain and hosting elsewhere but the whole idea of this project was to keep things really simple, have an easy place to call home on the internet and publish blog posts with minimal fuss.</p><p>I researched static website generators a bit and settled on <strong>Hexo</strong>. There are other ‘blog frameworks’ available like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a> which are well featured and supported, but I settled on Hexo for its apparent ease of use, my own familiarity with JavaScript and Markdown and a very simple deployment process which relies on nothing but a few simple terminal commands.</p><p>There are many guides to getting set up using Hexo online however in setting up this blog initially I had to gather info from various tutorials around the web and figure a few things out for myself.</p><p>This (first!) blog post attempts to bring all that knowledge together. It’s a long post but intentionally it’s just <em>one post</em> to keep everything together and provides, I hope, a complete guide to getting started.</p><p>Note - I am using <strong>Mac OS X</strong> as my platform of choice so bits of this guide will be specific to Mac. I imagine the set up for Linux is very similar. For Windows I imagine it’s quite similar and you can follow many of the steps, but I’m not a Windows user and so I’m afraid you’re on your own there, sorry! :)</p><hr><h2 id="Installing-Hexo"><a href="#Installing-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Installing Hexo"></a>Installing Hexo</h2><p>Hexo is a <em>’blogging framework’</em> which basically means it’s a bunch of tools for building simple webpages like this one. Using Node.js as a backbone, Hexo translates simple Markdown files in to well formatted HTML and bundles that together with some fancy CSS and JavaScript to create your published static webpage.</p><p>We have a bit of a ladder of installs to do here to get all we need to get going but the basic process to install Hexo is to install in the following order:</p><h3 id="Install-Homebrew"><a href="#Install-Homebrew" class="headerlink" title="Install Homebrew"></a>Install Homebrew</h3><p>Homebrew is a package manager for OS X that makes installing all kind of tools, packages and “linuxy things” a breeze. I already have that installed and if you’re reading this and have an interest in this kind of think i’m pretty sure you already have that set up too so we’ll skip over all the details, but as a simple reference run in a terminal:</p><pre><code>$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"</code></pre><p>You can verify it’s all OK by checking the version of Homebrew you’ve just installed:</p><pre><code>$ brew -v</code></pre><h3 id="Install-Node-js"><a href="#Install-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="Install Node.js"></a>Install Node.js</h3><p>Node.js is a JavaScript framework that basically allows you to run JavaScript outside of a browser (eg in a Terminal). The main thing we’re getting out of this that’s useful to us right now is a tool called <code>npm</code> (the <strong>N</strong>ode <strong>P</strong>ackage <strong>M</strong>anager). This is what we will use to install Hexo itself.</p><pre><code>$ brew install node</code></pre><p>Verify it’s all working by checking the version of npm installed:</p><pre><code>$ npm -v</code></pre><h3 id="Install-Hexo"><a href="#Install-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Install Hexo"></a>Install Hexo</h3><p>With Node.js and npm installed we can finally install Hexo itself:</p><pre><code>$ npm install hexo-cli -g</code></pre><p>to check you’re good to go run:</p><pre><code>$ hexo -v</code></pre><h2 id="Setting-up-first-site-template"><a href="#Setting-up-first-site-template" class="headerlink" title="Setting up first site template"></a>Setting up first site template</h2><p>Yay! We’re ready to go blogging. To kick things off, set up a new directory on disk somewhere sensible and in a terminal navigate there and run:</p><pre><code>$ hexo init NameOfMyAwesomeBlog</code></pre><p>This will download various bits and bobs and set up all the directory structure you need for your website. The structure will look a bit like this:</p><pre><code>.├── _config.yml├── node_modules├── package-lock.json├── package.json├── scaffolds│   ├── draft.md│   ├── page.md│   └── post.md├── source│   ├── _drafts│   ├── _posts│   ├── about│   ├── images└── themes    └── landscape</code></pre><p><code>_config.yml</code> as the name suggests is a really important file and defines a lot of the technical working of the blog. We’ll edit it in a bit once we’ve set up some git stuff below.</p><p>One of the beauties of Hexo is you don’t have to touch most of this stuff. You’ll dig in to <code>source</code> a bit when creating posts and <code>themes</code> initially to set up the look of the pages and whenever you want to tweak things like the js or css of your site, but you shouldn’t need to do much with themes once you find one you like. You can mess around with <code>scaffolds</code> if you like but it’s not really needed and the other stuff I frankly don’t need to touch at all.</p><p>We don’t even have to build or deploy the site to the web to see it in action. Hexo comes with a way to preview the webpage locally very easily. To install the server package run:</p><pre><code>$ npm install hexo-server --save</code></pre><p>and then:</p><pre><code>$ hexo server --draft --open</code></pre><p>This will host your page at <code>http://localhost:4000</code> and launch your web browser with your site in its current state. The <code>--draft</code> flag tells hexo to view both published and draft posts (see below). If you want to preview just the actual published content to see how your site will look to the outside world when deployed and not draft posts you can remove this flag.</p><p>When you install Hexo it comes with its own default website template called <strong>landscape</strong>. It’s OK but not very inspiring and you’ll probably want to choose your own later, however landscape is what we’re seeing now:</p><p><img src="/images/2020/03/hexo_landscape_002.jpg" alt=""></p><p>If you’re seeing something like this you’re in great shape and everything has installed correctly.</p><h2 id="Installing-a-theme"><a href="#Installing-a-theme" class="headerlink" title="Installing a theme"></a>Installing a theme</h2><p>I like a nice photo of planet Earth as much as the next person but before getting in to the process of writing posts I wanted to get a theme for my site that looked a bit better and more in keeping with the aims of this site to be simple, uncluttered and minimal. I chose <a href="https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cactus</strong></a> by GitHub user probberechts (thanks!).</p><p>From the root of your blog directory (the directory with the _config.yml file in it) run:</p><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus.git themes/cactus</code></pre><p>This will copy the theme in to the right place. Then open up <code>_config.yml</code> in a text editor and edit the line about theme, comment out landscape and set cactus:</p><pre><code># theme: landscapetheme: cactus</code></pre><p>Cactus also comes with 4 color options: white, classic, light and dark. I chose light. Add this below where you just set the theme in <code>_config.yml</code>:</p><pre><code>theme_config:  colorscheme: light</code></pre><p>If you refresh your webpage in your browser now you won’t see the change. Anytime you edit <code>_config.yml</code> you need to restart the hexo server. If you rerun:</p><pre><code>$ hexo server --draft --open</code></pre><p>You’ll see the changes and your new theme. You can dig in to the files in <code>./themes/cactus/</code> on your own to customize your page. The readme from probberechts on his Cactus theme’s GitHub page is really helpful too.</p><h2 id="Writing-first-content-to-get-going"><a href="#Writing-first-content-to-get-going" class="headerlink" title="Writing first content to get going"></a>Writing first content to get going</h2><p>If you’ve got this far you’re probably well and truly ready to start writing posts.</p><p>Hexo has a nice system whereby you can work on drafts of posts and not have them published when you build and deploy your scene until you’re ready to, it’s a good habit to get in to. To create a post run from the root directory of your blog:</p><pre><code>$ hexo new draft myPostName.md</code></pre><p>This will create a post in somewhere like:</p><pre><code>~/PATH/TO/BLOG/.../source/_drafts/myPostName.md</code></pre><p>I won’t go in to how to write in Markdown here, you can see the cheatsheet at the bottom of this post and hundreds of other resources online for better advice on that. Markdown is a fantastically intuitive way to write for the web and I highly recommend spending some time learning how to use it. It’s really quite simple and will serve you well beyond writing posts for your blog - it can become a very efficient way of writing notes and documents in many situations.</p><p>When you’re happy with your draft you can ‘publish’ the post which will move it from <code>_drafts</code>, a folder which doesn’t get included when you generate your site, in to <code>_posts</code>, which does. Run:</p><pre><code>$ hexo publish myPostName</code></pre><p>The ‘title matter’ of the markdown post will also get a timestamp now added with the publish date and time.</p><h2 id="Setting-yourself-up-with-GitHub-for-Hexo"><a href="#Setting-yourself-up-with-GitHub-for-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Setting yourself up with GitHub for Hexo"></a>Setting yourself up with GitHub for Hexo</h2><p>I started writing something for this section but found myself basically copying this blog post:</p><p><a href="http://jr0cket.co.uk/hexo/managing-hexo-website-content-with-git-and-github.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://jr0cket.co.uk/hexo/managing-hexo-website-content-with-git-and-github.html</a></p><p>Follow these instructions and you’ll get set up in no time.</p><h2 id="Deploying-the-Hexo-site-to-GitHub"><a href="#Deploying-the-Hexo-site-to-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="Deploying the Hexo site to GitHub"></a>Deploying the Hexo site to GitHub</h2><p>To build your site simply run the command:</p><pre><code>$ hexo generate</code></pre><p>and when you’re ready to deploy to the web:</p><pre><code>$ hexo deploy</code></pre><p>You can also combine these two commands in to one if you want to run them together:</p><pre><code>$ hexo deploy --generate</code></pre><h2 id="Trying-a-few-plugins"><a href="#Trying-a-few-plugins" class="headerlink" title="Trying a few plugins"></a>Trying a few plugins</h2><p>Plugins are ways of extending the functionality of Hexo. There are hundreds available, some are very powerful and some much more niche but all add new features to your Hexo set up.</p><p>I added a search page to this site very simply. First install the search plugin:</p><pre><code>$ npm install hexo-generator-search --save</code></pre><p>Then create a new page for the search to live in:</p><pre><code>$ hexo new page search</code></pre><p>this will create a new <code>index.md</code> page at <code>./source/search/</code> edit this file to add the search type:</p><pre><code>---title: Searchtype: search---</code></pre><p>Then to configure theme’s main <code>_config.yml</code> (in <code>./themes/cactus/_config.yml</code> in my case) to include it:</p><pre><code>nav:  search: /search/</code></pre><p>As another example, a simple plugin exists to be able to include emoji in your posts. Install the plugin:</p><pre><code>$ npm install hexo-filter-github-emojis --save</code></pre><p>This plugin needs a little bit more configuration. Edit your site’s main <code>_config.yml</code> file (the one at the sites root, not theme) to include:</p><pre><code>githubEmojis:  enable: true  className: github-emoji  inject: true  styles:  customEmojis:</code></pre><p>Now you can add emojis with the usual GitHub syntax of a <code>:</code> on each side of the emoji name eg <code>:thumbsup:</code> <span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png?v8">👍</span></p><p>A useful Emoji cheatsheet lives <span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f449.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f449.png?v8">👉</span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f448.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f448.png?v8">👈</span></p><h2 id="Maintaining-the-blog"><a href="#Maintaining-the-blog" class="headerlink" title="Maintaining the blog"></a>Maintaining the blog</h2><p>Maintaining the blog is very simple too. Just run the command:</p><pre><code>$ hexo clean</code></pre><p>to remove any previously built sites that are living in your root directory (don’t worry, everything is backed up and version controlled on Git - that’s the whole point of this system) and then generate and deploy your new site:</p><pre><code>$ hexo generate --deploy</code></pre><h2 id="Markdown-Cheatsheet"><a href="#Markdown-Cheatsheet" class="headerlink" title="Markdown Cheatsheet"></a>Markdown Cheatsheet</h2><p><img src="/images/2020/03/markdown_cheatsheet.jpg" alt=""></p><hr><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>
